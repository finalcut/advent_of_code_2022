#Intro
Since I'm learning rust and I'm forgetful.  Some tips.

## start a new project (day)

```rust
cargo new dayx
```
where x is the day we're starting.

## run the program

```rust
cargo run
```

you can do a `cargo build` but that is clunkier for our purposes here. We're trying to build and execute quickly.  So `cargo run` works
