# What the?
This is my code for solving a variety of problems around (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/2022].  A bunch of my co-workers at McGraw-Hill are doing it so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I decided to do at least some of it in Rust since I've never used Rust and I've heard great things about it.
